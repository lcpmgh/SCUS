#### Page 2: view (explore the inner relationship of data)

On this page, you can use different methods to explore the internal relationship of data, to help you better understand the data and build a more reliable mixing model. 

Select the method, determine the parameters, and click the plot button to complete the drawing. Please note that:

1. The change of length and width parameters will take effect immediately, and other parameters need to take effect by clicking the plot button. But for interactive image (like heat map), all parameters will not work until you click plot;
2.  Click the download button after drawing, the figure will be saved to the default download path of explorer;
3. For interactive image, the download button is in the upper right corner of the image area;
4. If the downloaded image is not clear or the font is too small, please adjust the image size and resolution to the appropriate value;
5. When there are too many tracers, it will take a long time to draw the correlation diagram. Please wait patiently.
