#### Part 2: Explore

This part offers different methods for exploring the internal relationships within your data. By selecting a method, determining the parameters, and clicking the plot button, you can better understand your data and build a more reliable mixing model. 

Note that:

1. Changing the length and width parameters will take effect immediately, but other parameters require clicking the plot button to take effect. For interactive images, such as heat maps, all parameters will not work until you click plot. 
2. After drawing, click the save button to save the image to your default download path. 
3. If you are working with an interactive image, such as a heat map, you can find the download button in the upper right corner of the image area once you have plotted it.
4. If the image is unclear or the font is too small, adjust the size and resolution to an appropriate value. 
5. When there are many tracers, it may take some time to draw the correlation diagram, so please be patient.
