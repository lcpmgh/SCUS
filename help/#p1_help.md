**SCUS**(Sediment Contribution Unmixing Software) is an auxiliary tool for the analysis work of the sediment source fingerprinting approach. There is a brief description of how to get started. 

The most important thing is to store your data in a comma-separated file correctly. You can store the source and target data in a single file (Integrated data) for input or input them separately (Source data and Target data). Please note that after successfully inputting the data, you need to restart the software if you want to replace another set of data. The input files should meet the following requirements:
